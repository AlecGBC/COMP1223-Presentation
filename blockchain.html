            Blockchain is a revolutionary concept; It is a way to store data in a way that it is accessible by everyone but cannot be tampered with once set. This doesnâ€™t seem like much at first until you consider the ways we do things as a society. Generally, if you wanted to make a trade you would either need to do it in person or through an institution such as Paypal or your credit card company. Or if you have a computerised timesheet at work, there is a database somewhere that can be modified. The fact that there is somebody in control of this important data means it is open to manipulation. The concept of blockchain is a solution to this problem.
