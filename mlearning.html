            When you make a spelling error on a Google search, an artificial intelligence is used. This is a very narrow AI, meaning it does not have many uses. The AI used to spell check must recognise a spelling error and correct it, only two tasks. To do this a pool of data is required, such as common spelling errors and their solutions. Machine learning works the same way, a pool of data is used to “teach” an AI. Often using trial an error until a task can be completed with high accuracy.
